he @SpringBootApplication includes the features of the below Spring Boot annotations:

@EnableAutoConfiguration - this will enable the auto-configuration feature of Spring Boot discussed earlier.
@Configuration - it specifies a configuration class, where youâ€™ll provide all the bean definitions that your application is using.
Spring Boot will use the bean definitions provided in the configuration class to instantiate them at runtime.
@ComponentScan - allows Spring Boot to scan the package for components like Service, Controller, Repository, etc.
and register beans for each of those classes.



-->above springboot annotation allows these speclization.

we konw that @EnableAutoconfiguration.
we konw that @Configuration . we should define bean .we springboot will create objects.
@ComponentScan -allows Spring Boot to scan the package for components like Service, Controller, Repository, etc.
                and register beans for each of those classes


but in ourcase. springboot creating objects automatically for us in conroller,service,respository classes.
but not in response class. we are @component . it is not creating object directly.
why? but  after declaring @Component.it is working perfectly.
